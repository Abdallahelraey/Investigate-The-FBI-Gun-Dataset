# <a id="Introduction"></a>
# ## Introduction
# 
# > **Key notes**: The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/).
# 
# > The NICS data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.
# 
# > The U.S. census data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (2016), but a few have data for more than one year.
# 
# > **Questions to explore**: 
# ><ol>
# ><li><a href="#q1">  The highest purchages record happened in which state for the persons under 18 years, percent on April 1, 2010?</a></li>
# ><li><a href="#q2">  What census data is most associated with high gun per capita?</a></li>
# ><li><a href="#q3">  Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations?</a></li>
# ><li><a href="#q4">  What is the overall trend of gun purchases?</a></li>
# ><li><a href="#q5">  What type of gun has highest quantity, and the relationship to totals?</a></li>
# ><li><a href="#q6">  What is the sum of registered gun in each state over time?</a></li>

# ### Conclusion

# > In the current study,a good amount of perfound analysis has been carried out.Prior to each step,prior to each step,detailed instructions was given and interpretations were provided afterwards.the  data set included two tables, the data was ranged from 1998 to 2017,which consested of detailed information on regestration gunsbased on substin, the analysis would be more reliable opposed to more small_scale analysis.
